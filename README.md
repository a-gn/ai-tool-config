# AI tool configuration files

This repository contains my personal configuration files for AI tools.
There are installation instructions that agents can be pointed to.

- `claude/project_setup` contains my typical new project setup for Claude Code. You can point Claude Code to `claude/project_setup/README.md` to make it install them into an existing project automatically.
- `claude/user_setup` contains my user-global setup for Claude Code. You can point Claude Code to `claude/user_setup/README.md` to make it install them into an existing project automatically.
