# Project-specific AI agent instructions

This folder contains instructions for Claude Code that can be inserted into a project's repository.

## Installation instructions

Always clean up any temporary files you've created while doing this, whether you succeed or abort.
VERY IMPORTANT: put all your temporary files in a temporary folder with a unique name, chosen with the system's utilities dedicated to this. ONLY delete files from the directory that you created. If you are not sure that you won't destroy files that you did not create yourself, DO NOT REMOVE ANYTHING and tell the user what the problem is.

- Fetch the entire folder containing this file. Prefer downloading it in one request with GitHub's ZIP repository archive URL. Extract them at the root of the project's repository.
- If there are conflicts, abort, return to the original state before you started this, and tell the user about it.
- Remove files specific to languages the project doesn't use, from the file hierarchy and the index. (If the project is a skeleton, guess from the existing configuration files and your context.)
- The repository's instructions should then be self-contained, without needing to fetch further files.
- Remove the current file from the repository you are setting up.
- If a git repository is set up, commit the new instructions and tell the user that you did. Don't push them.
