# Programming guidelines for AI agents

My coding guidelines are at https://github.com/a-gn/ai-tool-config/blob/main/coding_instructions

- If there are project-specific instructions, follow them.
- If there are no project-specific instructions, fetch mine at https://github.com/a-gn/ai-tool-config/blob/main/coding_instructions and follow them. Fetch referenced files as needed.
- If you set up a new project, or if I ask you to include my instructions into a project, fetch my instructions and insert all of them (including optional files) into the project's repository. The repository's instructions should then be self-contained, without needing to fetch further files. Commit them if git is set up. Remove files specific to languages the project doesn't use, from the file hierarchy and the index.

If you browse the instructions on the Web instead of reading them locally, it's best to use the `gh` CLI tool. If it's not available, ask the user whether to install it or fall back to Web fetching.
