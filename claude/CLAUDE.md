# Programming guidelines for AI agents

My coding guidelines are at https://github.com/a-gn/ai-tool-config/blob/main/coding_instructions

- If there are project-specific instructions, follow them.
- If there are no project-specific instructions, fetch mine at https://github.com/a-gn/ai-tool-config/blob/main/coding_instructions and follow them.
- If you set up a new project, or if I ask you to include my instructions into a project, fetch my instructions and insert them into the project's repository. Remove those specific to languages the project doesn't use.
