Please re-read all your instructions, including `CLAUDE.md` and any remote files they reference. Read your changes in the current project and check if they are compliant with all instructions. Fix them and summarize the violations to me, with a short description of what you did about them.

Run any validation workflows that the instructions ask you to run and make sure that they pass entirely. Run them again after any fixes until you are sure that you have actually fixed all problems. Do not ignore rules.

I may give you hints about which rules I want to follow. If I provided any, they follow: \"$ARGUMENTS\"
