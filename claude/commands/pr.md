I want you to open a pull request for your current tasks. If your task is not finished or the code is broken, warn me and don't go further unless I tell you to.

If you are done with the current tasks, validate and clean up the code with whatever process this project uses (type checking, linting, compilation, formatting, etc.), or any default methods in your instructions.

Make sure that you're in a branch different from the main one; you can create a new one if you need to. Then push all your changes and open a pull request. Then commit all changes that compose your current tasks, push them, and open a pull request. Make the title and description describe what's included concisely. Go to the point. Add anything that you think the reviewer needs to know about or could be surprised by.

You must try to commit a working, clean version of the project. If there are changes that are not linked to the tasks you were given, ask me if I want to commit them too. In all cases, the version you open the PR with should be self-contained and not break the project.

If this project is on GitHub, use the `gh` command.
