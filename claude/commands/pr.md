I want you to open a pull request for the current changes.

- Clean up the code with whatever process this project uses (type checking, linting, formatting, etc.), or any default methods in your instructions. Only run static analysis tools, not test suites, compilation, or other heavy processes, unless the project instructions tell you otherwise.
- Quickly read what the PR would change in the main branch (both git diff and previous commits) and build a title and description for the PR. Try to make this fast by only reading previous commit messages unless you need to dig deeper to understand. They should go to the point and be concise. The reviewer should quickly understand what changes at a high level and know what to review.
- Make sure that we are on a suitable branch that isn't the main one. If the current branch already has a remote and an appropriate name, stay on it. Otherwise, create a new branch with an appropriate name and switch to it.
- Commit and push to update the remote branch with all current changes, if that wasn't already done.
- Open a pull request to the main branch, using the branch, title, and description you choe above.

If the current changes seem incomplete or clearly broken to you, tell me what you think and ask me if I want to continue.

If this project is on GitHub, use the `gh` command.
