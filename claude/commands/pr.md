I want you to open a pull request for the current changes.

- Make sure that any prerequisites are fulfilled. If the user prompt, project prompt, project contributing guidelines, or previous instructions require that you make sure of something (e.g. that tests pass, that type checking is solid, that there are no linter errors), then make sure of that. If there are things to fix, tell me and ask if you should fix them. If the current changes seem incomplete or clearly broken to you, tell me what you think and ask me if I want to continue.
- Figure out what the PR would change at a high level and build a title and description for the PR. They should go to the point and be concise. The reviewer should quickly understand what changes at a high level and know what to review.
- Make sure that we are on a suitable branch that isn't the main one and whose name corresponds to what would be merged. If the current branch already has a remote and an appropriate name, stay on it. Otherwise, create a new branch with an appropriate name and switch to it.
- Commit and push to update the remote branch with all current changes, if that wasn't already done.
- Open a pull request to the main branch, using the branch, title, and description you chose above.

If this project is on GitHub, use the `gh` command.
