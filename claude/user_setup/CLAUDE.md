# Programming guidelines for AI agents

## If there are project-specific instructions

Follow the project's instructions. They take precedence over my personal instruction files.

## If there are no project-specific instructions

Fetch mine at https://github.com/a-gn/ai-tool-config/blob/main/claude/project_setup and follow them. Fetch referenced files as needed.

If you browse the instructions on the Web instead of reading them locally, it's best to use the `gh` CLI tool. If it's not available, ask the user whether to install it or fall back to Web fetching.
